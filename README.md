# SmartHome-NyumbaniConnect

SmartHome is a mobile-first digital platform that transforms the Kenyan real estate experience by offering verified property listings, tenant-landlord matching, and seamless service integration. Designed to solve fraud, long vacancy periods, and inefficient communication, SmartNyumba modernizes how property is rented, managed, and moved into.

##  Market Need

Kenyaâ€™s rental and property sales market suffers from:
- Fraudulent listings by fake landlords or agents
- Long vacancy periods due to poor tenant outreach
- Manual lease and payment processes
- Lack of bundled service integration (WiFi, water, cleaning)

With over 3 million urban renters and 80%+ smartphone penetration, there is a major opportunity to digitize this sector through a secure, transparent, and mobile solution.

##  Project Value

SmartNyumba offers:
-  Verified listings and user ID verification
-  Smart property search and match
-  Integrated service providers (e.g., internet, water)
-  Lease management and digital communication
-  Secure landlord-tenant-developer collaboration
-  Mobile-first access for convenience
